FAVORITE SHOW PROJECT 
Synopsis:
You and your friends have decided to keep track of all your favorite shows throughout the year. To make things easier for yourself, you have decided to build upon an existing app that keeps track of shows. But the app is missing some helpful functionalities. You’re a pro programmer so you’ve decided to take on the challenge.
Project Overview:
There are three functions you must implement located in the App.js file (this will serve as your starter code).

● deleteAll- this function clears the whole list of shows inputted.
● updateAll- this function updates the favorite season of all the shows to a certain number
● findAll- this function lists all the shows that have a specifc character as their favorite.
